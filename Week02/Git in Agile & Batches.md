### Git Repository Guidelines in Agile Development

- **Create a branching strategy**: Define a branching strategy that works for your team. A common approach is to use branches, where each branch corresponds to a particular feature. Another approach is to use a *trunk-based development* strategy, where all changes are made directly to the main branch.
- **Commit regularly**: In Agile development, it's important to commit changes regularly to ensure that everyone is working with the latest code. Commit small changes frequently, rather than large changes infrequently.
- **Descriptive commit messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain what changes were made and why. This helps team members understand what changes were made and makes it easier to review code.
- **Code reviews**: Use code reviews to ensure that code changes meet quality standards.
- **Pull request**:  Use pull requests to review and merge code changes. Pull requests provide an opportunity for team members to review changes before they are merged into the main branch.
- **Git tags**: Use Git tags to mark important milestones, such as releases or deployments. This makes it easier to track changes and roll back changes if necessary.
- **Git hooks**: Use Git hooks to automate tasks, such as running tests or deploying code. Git hooks can help ensure that code changes meet quality standards and reduce the risk of errors.

### Benefits of working in Batches in Agile

Working in small batches is an essential part in Agile Development. Batching refers to dividing larger tasks into smaller ones and then solving and testing them one by one. It is one of the core principles of Agile Development.

It is quick to get feedback about every batch. Following are some benefits of working in batches:

- **Improved Focus**: By breaking larger tasks into smaller batches, team members can focus their attention on specific tasks and ensure that they are completed with the required quality
- **Faster Feedback Loops**: Agile methodologies emphasize quick feedback loops, allowing teams to receive feedback and adapt more quickly. By working in batches, teams can receive feedback more frequently, which can lead to faster improvements and a more successful outcome.
- **Increased Flexibility**: Batching allows teams to adjust their priorities and adapt to changing circumstances more easily. They can quickly pivot to a new direction or adjust their approach as needed
- **Easier Planning**: By breaking down larger tasks into smaller batches, teams can more easily estimate the time and resources required to complete each batch.
- **Reduced Risk**: When working in batches, teams can reduce the risk of taking on too much work or making critical mistakes. They can focus on one batch at a time, ensuring that each one is completed correctly before moving on to the next.
